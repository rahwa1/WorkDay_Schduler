# WorkDay_Schduler

This project was made so that one can learn how to creat a calander for making a work day schedule. The schedule hours were made to be from 9-5 for the current date the person is working on. The current date was determined using momentsjs. The time blocks were added in to html file. The times were color coded based on wether it was past the time, present or future. Wasn't able to store the data into the local storage.
